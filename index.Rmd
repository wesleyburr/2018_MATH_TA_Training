## Professionalism

Some general notes about professionalism:

<br>
* This is a job, and you are an employee
* Professionalism on the part of both yourself, and your supervisor, is expected
* You are represented by a union (<a href="http://cupe3908.org/unit2.php">CUPE3908</a>) (probably Unit 2, possibly Unit 1)
* Issues!

## General Tips

Some general advice:

<br>
* The students are just as nervous as you are
* The students don't expect as much as you think they do
* The students deserve professionalism and preparation
* Try to remember what you thought when you were sitting in those seats ...

# Marking

---

class: inverse

## Marking

Most of you will end up marking (or have already marked!)

<br>
* Marking assignments and quizzes (typical for UTAs)
* Marking midterms, quizzes, tests and exams (more typical for GTAs)
* Have you ever marked before?

---

class: inverse

## General Tips to Help with Marking

* Use a marking scheme (**may** be provided by instructor)
* If there is more than one grader: meet to determine evaluation criteria, add **uniformity**
* Use "Range Finder" papers - randomly select 5 papers, evaluate but **don't grade** (that is, don't add marks, just determine right/wrong/why)
* **Read the entire question before beginning to grade**
* Track your time carefully!

---

class: inverse

## How to Mark

* Comments: be professional and respectful (encouragement is great!)
* Consistency is **really, really** important
* **Try** to only use red pen (backups: purple or green) - **never** blue, black or pencil
* Indicate where marks are lost (and how many)
* Give totals for each question
* Be prompt returning graded assignments - again, professionalism!
* Communicate with your instructor - don't try to solve it on your own!

---

class: inverse

## Some Specific Tips

* Write the page total at the corner of the page (quick adding)
* Mark all papers' Question 1, then all Question 2, ... (short-term memory capacity)
* Create a marking scheme for yourself (if not provided)
* Note what you have taken marks off for previous assignments/tests (consistency!)
* Count the assignments on pick up and before drop off
* Use a calculator to add up marks
* Ask instructor how to keep track of marks - usually a spreadsheet at Trent (Blackboard)

---

class: inverse

## Blackboard & Grades

* it's surprisingly annoying to use from admin side
* if you are asked to upload grades, and need help, **ask**
* any instructor should help - this is not a trivial task
* you probably won't be asked to do this ...

---

class: inverse

## Practicum

* two papers to mark
* we'll take them up
* present your strategy using the tablet!

# Tutorials
---

class: inverse

## Tutorial Leading

<br>
* How it works
* The purpose of a tutorial
* Examples of tutorial flow
* How to Prepare

---

class: inverse

## How it Works

* at least one hour of paid prep time for each week of tutorials in the same class
* often one hour of office hours (negotiated with instructor)
* may do only one tutorial, or as many as five
* UTAs hired via Colleen and the general course support budget (max theoretical hours)
* GTAs hired via GTA program, fixed support (max hours!)

---

class: inverse

## Possible Purposes of a Tutorial/Workshop/Seminar

* application of theoretical concepts
* review for tests and quizzes
* introducing alternative approaches to material
* presenting worked out examples
* possible outlet for students to present concerns (and frustrations!)

---

class: inverse

## Examples of Tutorial Flow (Lecture Style)

* Remind students what was taught since last meeting
* Motivate the material (applications, examples)
* Solve example problem(s) solo
* Ask for questions (dangerous!)

---

class: inverse

## Examples of Tutorial Flow (Help Session)

* **Much harder to do without experience**
* More free-form
* Be prepared for blank stares and no input
* Can solve a prepared question solo
* Interaction is key!
* **Need** to set expectations of student involvement from day 1

---

class: inverse

## Examples of Tutorial Flow (Hybrid)

* Possibly start with a contextual review
* Lead off with a prepared problem
* Follow up with free-form time
* Interaction remains key!
* Still **need** to set expectations of student involvement from day 1

---

class: inverse

## How to Prepare - General

* Review the material (lecture slides, provided guides or references)
    - where are students struggling?
* Solve (review!) your example question
    - Write it down and bring the solution
* Pick a few easy, moderate, and challenging questions
    - Write down the solution
   
Note that your workshops may be totally different from this (e.g., MATH 1051H, we set most of the workshop material ahead of time for my UTAs and GTAs). 
---

class: inverse

## Practicum

We're going to use Calculus as our working example, because everyone may be familiar with the topic?

* Imagine that the topic in the course this week is the product rule for differentiation
* You've been asked to **prepare** a problem to demo at the start of your workshop to motivate
* Do so, then we'll demonstrate / present

**Tips**:

* Keep it simpler than you think you should!
* Polynomials or exponentials base-e are best
